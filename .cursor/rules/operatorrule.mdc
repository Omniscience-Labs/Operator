The code for operator and operator propritory is hosted in vercel - frontend, render - backend and supabase - db. There is no local deployment to run queries or code changes, so everytime we have to push our changes and wait for dedployment and see changes/test changes. So only recommend me the code changes and when its time to test just tell me "please test on your own" and i will test myself and give output you do not need to do it
Always check for the entire code base to see how the request feature was created, a lot of the feature requested would have already been created in a particular way, make sure your implementation is following the same method, keep the changes simple and production ready. Your motivation should be to build features requested in the simplest but optimal way while giving priority to first seeing how the rest of the code has the same feature implemented.
