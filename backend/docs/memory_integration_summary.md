# Memory Integration Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the memory functionality that has been integrated into the Operator project using Mem0.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Memory Service (`utils/memory_service.py`)
- **AsyncMemoryClient Integration**: Robust wrapper around Mem0's AsyncMemoryClient
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles missing API keys and service unavailability
- **User/Agent Separation**: 
  - Default operator: Uses `user_id` only
  - Custom agents: Uses both `user_id` and `agent_id`
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling that doesn't disrupt conversations

### 2. ThreadManager Integration (`agentpress/thread_manager.py`)
- **Memory Search**: Automatic memory search before LLM calls
- **Context Injection**: Relevant memories added to system prompt
- **Memory Storage**: Conversation storage after assistant responses
- **Thread Information**: Caching of user_id and agent_id from database
- **Response Wrapping**: Memory-aware generators for both streaming and non-streaming responses

### 3. Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- Added `mem0ai>=0.1.0` package dependency

### 4. Documentation
- **Setup Guide**: Complete setup and configuration instructions
- **API Examples**: Code examples for both default and custom agents
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Privacy Notes**: Security and privacy considerations

## How It Works

### Memory Flow for Default Operator

```
User Message → Memory Search → Context Added to Prompt → LLM Response → Store Conversation
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓              ↓
"Hello"     → Search memories    → Add relevant context → AI responds → Store user+AI exchange
              with user_id         to system prompt      using context   with user_id only
```

### Memory Flow for Custom Agents

```
User Message → Memory Search → Context Added to Prompt → LLM Response → Store Conversation
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓              ↓
"Hello"     → Search memories    → Add relevant context → AI responds → Store user+AI exchange
              with user_id +       to system prompt      using context   with user_id + agent_id
              agent_id
```

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for memory functionality
MEM0_API_KEY=your-mem0-api-key-here
```

### Setup Steps
1. Get API key from [Mem0](https://mem0.ai)
2. Set environment variable
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Restart the backend service

## Code Changes Made

### New Files Added
- `backend/utils/memory_service.py` - Memory service implementation
- `backend/docs/memory_integration.md` - User documentation
- `backend/docs/memory_integration_summary.md` - Implementation summary

### Files Modified
- `backend/agentpress/thread_manager.py` - Added memory integration
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Added mem0ai dependency

### Integration Points
1. **Memory Search**: Before LLM calls in `ThreadManager._run_once()`
2. **Memory Storage**: After responses in memory-aware generators
3. **Thread Context**: Database queries to get user_id and agent_id
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch blocks with logging

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Automatic Memory Search
- Searches relevant memories using user's latest message
- Adds context to system prompt automatically
- Handles structured message content (text extraction)

### ✅ Conversation Storage
- Stores user-assistant exchanges after responses
- Filters to only store relevant content (user/assistant messages)
- Handles both streaming and non-streaming responses

### ✅ User/Agent Isolation
- Separate memory spaces for different users
- Agent-specific memories for custom agents
- No cross-user memory leakage

### ✅ Robust Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when Mem0 unavailable
- Service continues without memory if API key missing
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- Thread info caching to reduce database queries
- Limited memory search results (5 by default)
- Minimal code changes to existing functionality

## Memory Context Format

When memories are found, they're added to the system prompt as:

```
## Relevant Context from Previous Conversations:
1. User mentioned traveling to San Francisco last week
2. User prefers morning meetings
3. User is working on a React project
4. User has a budget constraint of $1000
5. User previously asked about deployment options

```

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing
1. Start a conversation with the operator
2. Mention specific information (e.g., "I live in New York")
3. Start a new conversation
4. Ask something related (e.g., "What's the weather like where I live?")
5. The agent should reference your previous location mention

### With Custom Agents
1. Create a custom agent
2. Have a conversation with specific context
3. Start a new conversation with the same custom agent
4. The agent should remember the previous context
5. Switch to a different custom agent - it should NOT have the same memories

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Log Levels
- **INFO**: Memory search results found
- **DEBUG**: Memory storage operations
- **WARNING**: Service initialization issues
- **ERROR**: Failed memory operations

### Log Examples
```
INFO - Found 3 relevant memories for thread abc123
DEBUG - Added 2 messages to memory for thread abc123
WARNING - MEM0_API_KEY not set, memory service disabled
ERROR - Failed to search memories for thread abc123: Connection timeout
```

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Memory Categories**: Categorize memories by topic/type
2. **Memory Expiration**: Automatic cleanup of old memories
3. **Memory Summarization**: Compress old memories to save space
4. **User Memory Management**: Allow users to view/delete their memories
5. **Memory Analytics**: Track memory usage and effectiveness

### Configuration Options
1. **Search Limit**: Make memory search limit configurable
2. **Memory Filters**: Filter memories by date, importance, etc.
3. **Context Template**: Customizable memory context formatting
4. **Agent Memory Sharing**: Option to share memories between related agents

## Security and Privacy

### Data Handling
- All memories are stored on Mem0's infrastructure
- User data is isolated by user_id and agent_id
- No sensitive information is logged in application logs
- Memory operations follow Mem0's security guidelines

### Access Control
- Users can only access their own memories
- Custom agents have separate memory spaces
- No cross-user or cross-agent memory access

This implementation provides a robust, scalable foundation for conversational memory in the Operator project while maintaining minimal disruption to existing functionality.
