-- IMPLEMENT MANAGED AGENTS
-- This migration implements managed agents functionality allowing users to get live references 
-- to agents instead of copies. When an agent is published as "managed", users get the latest version automatically.
-- 
-- NOTE: This migration is now handled entirely by 20250715000000_final_cleanup_and_fixes.sql
-- to avoid dependency issues when agents/user_agent_library tables don't exist yet.
